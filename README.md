# Static-Scheduling-of-Graph-Tasks-on-Multiprocessor-Systems
Implemented and Analysed results of different algorithms for static scheduling of graph tasks on multiprocessor systems using task duplication strategy. Worked on different types of DAG's to compare these algorithms with respect to make span,number of processors required and power consumption.
